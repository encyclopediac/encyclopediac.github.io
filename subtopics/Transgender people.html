Additionally, transgender women's increased likelihood of having denser breast tissue also independently increases the odss of breast cancer. Though the odds of breast cancer are lower than that in cisgender women, it is still recommended that transgender women perform mammograms past the age of 50, if they have taken feminising HRT for a long time. As for cervical cancer,it is recognised that transgender women who have not gone under any form of vaginoplasty have no risk of cervical cancer. For those that have, based on the most common technique, there is a noticably increased risk in dysplasia and certain invasive cancers. Though the risk overall is low, it is recommended for post-operative transgender women to consult with their doctors and to have regular check ups for this threat. Therefore: it is fair to say that transgender women, on average, have higher odds of breast cancer than cisgender men; that for cervical cancer, though the odds are low, post-operative transgender women face a noticeable increased risk of cervical cancers through HPV; that it is medically recommended for them to treat all of these risks seriously like with cisgender women; and that healthcare and medical responses to transgender women's needs must account for these risks.</li></ul>

<ul><li>SUMMARY: Because of the increase in exogenous estrogen in HRT-taking trans women, their odds for beast cancer naturally rise. Therefore: transwomen taking estrogen for HRT have higher odds of breast cancer than cisgender men.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Moreover, in the literature, there is evidence that both testosterone and estrogen may play a role in breast cancer risk. Testosterone is thought to have a protective effect, and estrogen a stimulating effect. Because transwomen are commonly treated with both estrogen and anti-androgens, the increase of circulating estrogen and loss of circulating testosterone could contribute to the observed increased breast cancer risk compared with cisgender men.</li></ul>

<ul><li>SUMMARY: Because estrogen is a carcinogen of breast tissue, transgender women face higher odds of breast cancer. Futhermore, increasing the 'length of exposure to estrogens' adds to this risk. Transgender women have a high odds of having denser breast tissue, which also increases the risk of breast cancer. The odds of breast cancer overall appear to be lower than in cisgender women, though mammograms at the age of 50 and beyond (and after taking estrogen for many years) are still recommended. Therefore: transgender women who take estrogens and anti-androgens have a higher risk of breast cancer than cisgender men, though lower than cisgender women; transgender women have a higher likelihood of having more dense breast tissue, which independently can increase the risk; these reasons are why it is recommended that the take regular mammograms past the age of 50 if they have taken HRT for a long time.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Estrogen and its metabolites have been confirmed as carcinogens of breast tissue. Additionally, in cisgender individuals, the length and amount of exposure to estrogens is thought to add to breast cancer risk. Therefore, transgender women undergoing medical transition with exogenous estrogens have hormonal factors contributing to their increased breast cancer risk when compared with cisgender men.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>transgender women have a higher prevalence (60%) of dense breast tissue, an independent risk for breast cancer, and increased rates of false-negative mammograms.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>because of the likely lower incidence of breast cancer in transgender women, screening mammography should not begin before the age of 50. For transgender women not beginning estrogen therapy until after age 50, it is not recommended to begin breast cancer screening until a minimum of 5 years of feminizing hormone use.</li></ul>

<ul><li>SUMMARY: Feminising hormones, and anti-androgens, taken by transgender women increase the odds of breast cancer comapred to cisgender men. Additionally, genetics may also increase or lower risks, depending. Similarly to the last source, it is recommended that mammogram screenings are done after tha age of 50, and after taking feminising hormones for 5 years. Therefore: transgender women who take feminising hormes as part of HRT have a higher risk of breast cancer than cisgender men, and they ought ot have mammogram screenings past the age of 50 if they have taken HRT for a long period of time.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Transgender women may have a greater chance of getting breast cancer due to the medicines they take to boost female hormones and lower male hormones. A person’s family history and genetic makeup can also increase their chances of breast cancer.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>If you are 50 years of age or older and you had at least 5 years of hormonal therapy, you should have a screening mammogram every 2 years.</li></ul>

<ul><li>SUMMARY: Transgender women who have operative surgeries to produce a vagina/cervix have a present, though small, risk of cervical cancer depending on the type of surgery that was had. It is still recommened to speak to a professional to determine if cancer screenings are necessary. Therefore: transgender who had operative surgeries have hgiher risk of cervical cancer, depending on the surgery, which must be accounted for, though the overall risk is low.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>If you’re a trans woman and have not had bottom surgery, you aren’t at risk for cervical cancer.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>If, however, you’re a trans woman who has had bottom surgery to create a vagina (vaginoplasty) and possibly a cervix, there’s a very small risk that you can develop cancer in the tissues of your neo-vagina or neo-cervix. The risk depends on the type of surgery you had, the type of tissue used to create your vagina and cervix and your personal health history. Talk to your healthcare provider to figure out your specific cancer-screening needs as part of your overall pelvic health following surgery.</li></ul>

<ul><li>SUMMARY: It is possible for women who have operations to develop neovaginas to contract human papillomavirus (HPV) which can lead to 'dysplasia or invasive cancer'. Additionally, through the most common technique for such operations, it naturally carries the risk of contracting HPV and thus dysplasia. No exhaustive data exists presently of the rate of transgdner women with neovaginas getting cervical cancer, though medical recommendations still include 'routine examination' for HPV in post-operative transgender women. Therefore: theoretically, the methods for vaginoplasty increase the likelihood of cervical cancer; there is no exhaustive data analysing the rate of cervical cance rin transgender women (neither meaning we know for a fact if the rate is higher or lower than expected); and it is medically recommended for routine checks to be made amongst post-operative transgender women though due to those risks. </li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>human papillomavirus (HPV)</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Transgender women with surgically created neovaginas are also at risk for contracting HPV and subsequently developing dysplasia or invasive cancer.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Neovagina creation in transgender women through penile inversion is the most common technique for vaginoplasty, which results in the keratinized skin from the penile shaft lining the neovagina and a portion of the glans penis creating a neoclitoris. Like all keratinized skin, the neovagina is also susceptible to HPV-induced dysplasia.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Additionally, the development of diversion colitis, from the diversion of the fecal stream resulting in a deficiency of nutrients for the colonocytes, leads to long-term inflammation, which theoretically can be associated with increased cancer risk of the neovagina. However, as with all cancer data in the transgender population, no specific incidence or prevalence data exists on cancers of the neovagina. Transgender women who have undergone vaginoplasty, regardless of method, should receive routine examination for the presence of HPV condyloma.</li></ul>
