<h3 id=5-1-1_content_summary:><a href="#5-1-1_content_summary:">Content summary:</a></h3><ul><li>For conversion of sexual orientation: not only is sexual orientation not something which is necessary to alter, the process of altering sexual orientation produces harmful psychological effects and is unlikely to even be able to change the sexual orientation of a person. For gender identity, similarly: the process of relying on conversion as a tactic rather than a more compassionate form of therapy leads to increased suicide attempts during a person's lifetime; and it is not something that should be converted in the first place, making the practise unethical and inhumane. Therefore: conversion therapy of sexual attraction and gender identity alike are inhumane practices to attempt to fix what does not require fixing; the practise universally leads to worse psychological outcomes and the feautures it attempts to convert are not features worth converting; this means this should not be advocated as policy, and opposed where it is still practised.</li></ul>

<ul><li>SUMMARY: This Cornell meta-analysis reviews 47 different studies, and finds that there is not reliable or credible argument to be made that conversion therapy has any ability to change a person's sexuality. Furthermore, such attempts to do so are increadibly harmful. Therefore: the overwhelming consensus of this issue by medical experts is that conversion therapy is a harmful practice and is not able to change a person's sexuality.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>We identified 47 peer-reviewed studies that that met our criteria for adding to knowledge about whether conversion therapy (CT) can alter sexual orientation without causing harm. Thirteen of those studies included primary research. Of those, 12 concluded that CT is ineffective and/or harmful, finding links to depression, suicidality, anxiety, social isolation and decreased capacity for intimacy. Only one study concluded that sexual orientation change efforts could succeed—although only in a minority of its participants, and the study has several limitations: its entire sample self-identified as religious and it is based on self-reports, which can be biased and unreliable. The remaining 34 studies do not make an empirical determination about whether CT can alter sexual orientation but may offer useful observations to help guide practitioners who treat LGB patients.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>we concluded that there is no credible evidence that sexual orientation can be changed through therapeutic intervention. Most accounts of such change are akin to instances of “faith healing.” There is also powerful evidence that trying to change a person’s sexual orientation can be extremely harmful. Taken together, the overwhelming consensus among psychologists and psychiatrists who have studied conversion therapy or treated patients who are struggling with their sexual orientation is that therapeutic intervention cannot change sexual orientation, a position echoed by all major professional organizations in the field, including the American Psychological Association whose substantial 2009 report is available here.</li></ul>

<ul><li>SUMMARY: This report by the American Psychological Association finds that: same-sex attractions is normal (and therefore not disorders); sexuality may be fluid in nature for some; same-sex attraction (homosexuality and bisexuality in this instance) is often stigmatised which quantifiably harms people; same-sex relationships are essentially analogous to heterosexual ones. As for conversion therapy specifically: studies which claim to show that conversion therapy is able to alter a person's sexuality have serious methodological issues; the best clinical help is one which is characterised by '(a) acceptance and support, (b) a comprehensive assessment, (c) active coping, (d) social support, and (e) identity exploration and development'; that the ability of conversion therapy to change one's orientation is unlikely; and that treatment based on stigma is 'unlikely to result in psychological well-being'. Therefore: it is not possible to advocate for conversion therapy for sexual orientation in a humane manner, nor is it a necessary evil that solves an issue worth solving.</li></ul>

<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>As part of the fulfillment of its charge, the task force undertook an extensive review of the recent literature on psychotherapy and the psychology of sexual orientation. There is a growing body of evidence concluding that sexual stigma, manifested as prejudice and discrimination directed at non-heterosexual sexual orientations and identities, is a major source of stress for sexual minorities.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>We see this multiculturally competent and affirmative approach as grounded in an acceptance of the following scientific facts:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>Same-sex sexual attractions, behavior, and orientations per se are normal and positive variants of human sexuality—in other words, they do not indicate either mental or developmental disorders.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>Homosexuality and bisexuality are stigmatized, and this stigma can have a variety of negative consequences (e.g., minority stress) throughout the life span.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>Same-sex sexual attractions and behavior occur in the context of a variety of sexual orientations and sexual orientation identities, and for some, sexual orientation identity (i.e., individual or group membership and affiliation, self-labeling) is fluid or has an indefinite outcome.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>Gay men, lesbians, and bisexual individuals form stable, committed relationships and families that are equivalent to heterosexual relationships and families in essential respects.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>The review covered the peer-reviewed journal articles in English from 1960 to 2007. Most studies in this area were conducted before 1981, and only a few studies have been conducted in the last 10 years.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>We found serious methodological problems in this area of research; only a few studies met the minimal standards for evaluating whether psychological treatments such as efforts to change sexual orientation are effective.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>We concluded that the early high-quality evidence is the best basis for predicting what the outcome of valid interventions would be.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>The clinical literature indicated that adults perceive a benefit when they are provided with client-centered, multicultural, evidence-based approaches that provide (a) acceptance and support, (b) a comprehensive assessment, (c) active coping, (d) social support, and (e) identity exploration and development.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Our systematic review of the early research found that enduring change to an individual’s sexual orientation was unlikely</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Our review of the scholarly literature on individuals distressed by their sexual orientation indicated that clients perceived a benefit when offered interventions that emphasize acceptance, support, and recognition of important values and concerns.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Studies indicate that experiences of stigma—such as self-stigma, shame, isolation and rejection from relationships and valued communities, lack of emotional support and accurate information, and conflicts between multiple identities and between values and attractions—played a role in creating distress in individuals. Many religious individuals desired to live their lives in a manner consistent with their values (telic congruence); however, telic congruence based on stigma and shame is unlikely to result in psychological well-being.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Research indicates that family interventions that reduce rejection and increase acceptance of their child and adolescent are helpful. </li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>We encourage APA to continue its advocacy for LGBT individuals and families and to oppose stigma, prejudice, discrimination, and violence directed at sexual minorities. We recommend that APA take a leadership role in opposing the distortion and selective use of scientific data about homosexuality by individuals and organizations and in supporting the dissemination of accurate scientific and professional information about sexual orientation in order to counteract bias. We encourage APA to engage in collaborative activities with religious communities in pursuit of shared prosocial goals when such collaboration can be done in a mutually respectful manner that is consistent with psychologists’ professional and scientific roles.</li></ul>

<ul><li>SUMMARY: From a sample size of 27,715 transgender individuals,  conversion efforts were associated with more psychological harm/distress than non-conversion therapy. An association was also found between these conversion efforts fone to children younger than 10 years-old increased suicide attempts, and between lifetime exposure to conversion and lifetime suicide attempts. No difference in results appears to exist between conversion done from a religious background or a secular one. Therefore: this practise appears to produce significant harm when done on children or individuals at any other point in life; as such it cannot be condoned as a humane practise or proposed policy.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Of 27 715 transgender survey respondents (mean [SD] age, 31.2 [13.5] years)</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Gender identity conversion efforts (GICE)</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Among the 19 741 (71.3%) who had ever spoken to a professional about their gender identity, 3869 (19.6%; 95% CI, 18.7%-20.5%) reported exposure to GICE in their lifetime. Recalled lifetime exposure was associated with severe psychological distress during the previous month (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.56; 95% CI, 1.09-2.24; P < .001) compared with non-GICE therapy. Associations were found between recalled lifetime exposure and higher odds of lifetime suicide attempts (aOR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.60-3.24; P < .001) and recalled exposure before the age of 10 years and increased odds of lifetime suicide attempts (aOR, 4.15; 95% CI, 2.44-7.69; P < .001). No significant differences were found when comparing exposure to GICE by secular professionals vs religious advisors.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>The findings suggest that lifetime and childhood exposure to GICE are associated with adverse mental health outcomes in adulthood. These results support policy statements from several professional organizations that have discouraged this practice.</li></ul>

<ul><li>SUMMARY: This statement by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry also argues that conversion therapy for gender identity is harmful. Furthermore, they argue that, like with sexual orientation, gender identity is not something which ought to be fixed or converted and that actual professional help involved not presuming an outcome before starting. Therefore: conversion therapy for gender indentity should not be pursued, not just because it leads to negative psychological outcomes, but because gender identity is not something which ought to be fixed.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Variations in sexual orientation and gender expression represent normal and expectable dimensions of human development. They are not considered to be pathological; therefore, they are not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, and other accepted nosological systems [...] Health promotion for all youth encourages open exploration of all identity issues, including sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or gender expression according to recognized practice guidelines</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>“Conversion therapies” (or “reparative therapies”) are interventions purported to alter same-sex attractions or an individual’s gender expression with the specific aim to promote heterosexuality as a preferable outcome</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>These interventions are provided under the false premise that homosexuality and gender diverse identities are pathological. They are not; the absence of pathology means there is no need for conversion or any other like intervention. </li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Further, there is evidence that “conversion therapies” increase risk of causing or exacerbating mental health conditions in the very youth they purport to treat </li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>In the presence of gender dysphoria (distress related to the incongruence between gender identity and sex assigned at birth), the standard of care may involve exploration of living in a different gender role (appropriate to the child or adolescent’s developmental understanding of gender) and/or potential use of affirming gender transition interventions to align anatomical features with one’s gender identity for appropriately assessed pubertal adolescents [...] This follows recognized standards of care and is not considered “conversion therapy.”</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry finds no evidence to support the application of any “therapeutic intervention” operating under the premise that a specific sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or gender expression is pathological. Furthermore, based on the scientific evidence, the AACAP asserts that such “conversion therapies” (or other interventions imposed with the intent of promoting a particular sexual orientation and/or gender as a preferred outcome) lack scientific credibility and clinical utility.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>there is evidence that such interventions are harmful. As a result, “conversion therapies” should not be part of any behavioral health treatment of children and adolescents.</li></ul>

<ul><li>SUMMARY: This Memorandum from the UK highlights what has already been shown by other sources on this topic: no gender identity or sexual orientation is inherently superior or should be promoted over others; and that conversion therapy is 'unethical and harmful'. Therefore: conversion therapy ought not be pursued because it is broadly agreed by a large collection of expert organisations to be unethical and not serving a necessary purpose.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>For the purposes of this document ’conversion therapy’ is an umbrella term for a therapeutic approach, or any model or individual viewpoint that demonstrates an assumption that any sexual orientation or gender identity is inherently preferable to any other, and which attempts to bring about a change of sexual orientation or gender identity, or seeks to supress an individual’s expression of sexual orientation or gender identity on that basis.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>These efforts are sometimes referred to by terms including, but not limited to, ‘reparative therapy’, ‘gay cure therapy’, or ‘sexual orientation and gender identity change efforts’, and sometimes may be covertly practised under the guise of mainstream practice without being named.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>For the purpose of this document, sexual orientation refers to the sexual or romantic attraction someone feels to people of the same sex, opposite sex, more than one sex, or to experience no attraction.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>For the purposes of this document, gender identity is interpreted broadly to include all varieties of binary (male or female), non-binary and gender fluid identities.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Signatory organisations agree that the practice of conversion therapy, whether in relation to sexual orientation or gender identity, is unethical and potentially harmful.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Signatory organisations agree that neither sexual orientation nor gender identity in themselves are indicators of a mental disorder.</li></ul>
