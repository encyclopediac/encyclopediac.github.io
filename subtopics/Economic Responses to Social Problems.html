What has been found is that tax-breaks provide no significant improvements in economic metrics (e.g unemployment and growth), and have a causal link to increasing pre-tax income inequality. Furthermore, inside of firms, tax-breaks may (though in this case the data is less exhaustive) provide more icome/contribution benefits to executives than average income earners at a firm. Therefore: tax-breaks are ineffective policy at improving economic performance, and ought not be pursued; and the framework of 'trickle-down' is not meaningfully substantiated.</li></ul>

<ul><li>SUMMARY: As seen from data from 18 OECD countries, as analysed by the London School of Economics, tax breaks as a tool to help make wealth trickle-down, fail at improving economic growth or unemployment, but consistently increasing pre-tax income inequality between the 1% highest pre-tax earners at the rest of earners. The data shows a causal link between tax-cutting and income inequality growth, and no impact on economic performance metrics. Therefore: the exhaustive data shows that tax-breaks are ineffective policy at improving economic performance and causually leads to more income inequality. </li></ul>

<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>This paper uses data from 18 OECD countries over the last five decades to estimate the causal effect of major tax cuts for the rich on income inequality, economic growth, and unemployment</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>We find that major reforms reducing taxes on the rich lead to higher income inequality as measured by the top 1% share of pre-tax national income. The effect remains stable in the medium term. In contrast, such reforms do not have any significant effect on economic growth and unemployment.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>We find that major tax cuts for the rich push up income inequality, as measured by the top 1% share of pre-tax national income. The size of the effect is substantial: on average, each major tax cut results in a rise of 0.8 percentage points in top 1% share of pre-tax national income. The effect holds in both the short and medium term. Turning our attention to economic performance, we find no significant effects of major tax cuts for the rich. More specifically, the trajectories of real GDP per capita and the unemployment rate are unaffected by significant reductions in taxes on the rich in both the short and medium term.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>[the data] provide causal evidence that supports the growing pool of evidence from correlational studies that cutting taxes on the rich increases top income shares, but has little effect on economic performance (Lee and Gordon, 2005; Piketty et al., 2014; Roine et al., 2009).</li></ul>

<ul><li>SUMMARY: The two tax-breaks analysed, from the USA, were seen to increase the income/compensation of executives more so than of the average wage of the firms. Therefore: tax-breaks lead to increased income inequality inside of firms.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>I analyze the effect of two corporate tax breaks, bonus depreciation and the Domestic Production Activities Deduction (DPAD), on executive compensation in publicly traded US firms. I find both tax breaks significantly increase executive compensation. For every dollar a firm benefits from the tax breaks, compensation of the firm’s top five highest paid executives increases by 15 to 19 cents. These effects are much larger than the effect of corporate tax cuts on average wages, suggesting the tax breaks increase within-firm income inequality.</li></ul>
