<ul><li>SUMMARY:</li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>In this study, we use the term “temptation goods” principally to refer to alcohol and tobacco. This study makes no normative assumption as to the value of alcohol and tobacco expenditures but merely seeks to systematically characterize the literature on the impact of cash transfers on these goods.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Most cash transfer programs are not focused on either increasing or decreas- ing consumption of these goods specifically, and so most evaluations and the subsequent reviews have not focused on these. Rather, reviews have focused on outcomes in schooling (Saavedra and García 2013; Baird et al. 2014), health (Leroy, Ruel, and Verhofstadt 2009; Ranganathan and Lagarde 2012), con- sumption (Fiszbein and Schady 2009), or a combination of these (IEG 2011). At the same time, many individual evaluations of cash transfer programs have included analysis of the impact on some set of temptation goods within their consumption analysis.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Across 50 estimates from 19 studies, we find that almost without exception, studies find either no significant impact or a significant negative impact of trans- fers on expenditures on alcohol and tobacco. Moreover, our meta-analysis for those studies reporting impacts of transfers on total temptation good expen- diture yields a negative, significant average effect. Several robustness checks, in- cluding restricting to randomized trials alone, likewise yield negative (insignif- icant) average effects. </li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>The evidence suggests that cash transfers are not used for alcohol and tobacco at any significant levels, irrespective of region or program design.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>This finding informs the policy debate in many low-income countries as to whether to introduce cash transfer programs. The vast majority of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have formally discussed, planned, or piloted some form of cash transfer program (Garcia and Moore 2012). It also informs policy sur- rounding the choice between cash and in-kind transfers, as has been debated in India over the last several years (Drèze 2011; Times of India 2013), insofar as that debate is at least partly driven by public concern that recipients are more likely to spend cash transfers on temptation goods than they are to spend in-kind transfers (Khera 2014). By demonstrating that cash transfers do not in fact increase spending on temptation goods, we implicitly answer this question and further dispel concerns surrounding cash transfers.</li></ul>

<ul><li>SUMMARY: test</li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>We re-analyze the data from seven randomized con- trolled trials of government-run cash transfer programs in six developing countries throughout the world, and find no systematic evidence that cash transfer programs discourage work.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Chetty and Looney (2007) show that social insurance as a fraction of GDP rises as countries get richer, suggesting that safety nets may be increasingly important as countries grow and develop.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Aggregating evidence from random- ized evaluations of seven government cash transfer programs, we find no systematic evidence of an impact of transfers on work behavior, either for men or women. Moreover, a 2014 review of transfer programs worldwide by Evans and Popova (2014) also shows no evidence—despite claims in the policy debate—that the transfers induce increases in spending on temptation goods, such as alcohol and tobacco. Thus, on net, the available evidence implies that cash transfer programs do not induce the “bad” behaviors that are often attributed to them in the policy space. Combined with the positive effects of transfer programs documented in the literature, this suggests that transfers can be an effective policy lever to help combat poverty and inequality.</li></ul>

<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>for just over half of studies on adult work (participation and intensity), the cash transfer does not have a statistically significant impact. Among those studies reporting a significant effect among adults of working age, the majority find an increase in work participation and intensity.

<ul><li>SUMMARY: test</li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Monetary Poverty</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>There is a comparatively large evidence base linking cash transfers to reductions in monetary poverty. The evidence extracted consistently shows an increase in total and food expenditure and reduction in Foster–Greer–Thorbecke (FGT) poverty measures.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>While cash transfers are shown to mostly increase total and food expenditure, it appears that in many cases this impact is not big enough to have a subsequent effect on aggregate poverty levels. However, with one exception, the studies consistently show decreases in poverty.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Education</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>available evidence highlights a clear link between cash transfer receipt and increased school attendance. Less evidence and a less clear-cut pattern of impact is found for learning outcomes (as measured by test scores) and cognitive development outcomes (information processing ability, intelligence, reasoning, language development and memory), although, interestingly, the three studies reporting statistically significant findings on the latter all report improvements in cognitive development associated with cash transfer receipt.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>20 studies disaggregate findings by sex (either by sex of the child or head of the household), with statistically significant effects being increases in school attendance for girls </li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Health and Nutrition</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>Evidence of the impacts of cash transfers across all three indicator areas – use of health services, dietary diversity and anthropometric measures – was largely consistent in terms of direction of effect, showing improvements in the indicators. </li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>The available evidence shows that, on the whole, cash transfers – both CCTs and UCTs – have increased the uptake of health services. Of the 15 studies reporting overall effects on the use of health facilities, nine report statistically significant increases. For dietary diversity, findings also consistently show increases. Among the 12 studies reporting on impacts on dietary diversity, seven show statistically significant changes across a range of dietary diversity measures, all being improvements. Evidence of statistically significant changes in anthropometric outcomes is limited to five out of 13 studies for stunting, one out of five for wasting and one out of eight for underweight. All significant overall changes were improvements.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Savings, investment and production</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>Overall, impacts on savings, and on livestock ownership and/or purchase, as well as use and/or purchase of agricultural inputs, are consistent in their direction of effect, with almost all statistically significant findings highlighting positive effects of cash transfers, though these are not universal to all programmes or to all types of livestock and inputs. </li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li> of the 10 studies that look at the overall effect of cash transfers on household savings, half find statistically significant increases in the share of households reporting savings (ranging from seven to 24 percentage points) or the amount of savings accumulated. Impacts on borrowing were mixed. Of the 15 studies, four report significant increases, three report significant reductions, one reports mixed findings and the remainder are not statistically significant.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Employment</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>for just over half of studies on adult work (participation and intensity), the cash transfer does not have a statistically significant impact. Among those studies reporting a significant effect among adults of working age, the majority find an increase in work participation and intensity. In the cases in which a reduction in work participation or work intensity is reported, these reflect a reduction in participation among the elderly, those caring for dependents, or they are the result of reductions in casual work.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>14 studies report on the effect on overall adult labour force participation: among the eight that report on adults of working age, four find statistically significant impacts: three being increases and one a decrease. Among the two studies on elderly adults, one finds a significant effect in terms of reducing pensioners working for pay. 10 studies report on overall adult intensity of work, with six studies showing statistically significant impacts. Three involved reductions in time worked, though one was among the elderly. The two interventions resulting in increases in time spent working resulted from enterprise grants specificially intended to increase employment.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>Studies on sector of work show that in over half of the studies cash transfers did not significantly affect overall participation in the specific sectors studied</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>More specifically, a total of 19 studies report cash transfer impacts on child labour force participation. Of the eight studies that find any significant impact, all show a decrease in child labour.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Empowerment</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>available evidence shows that transfers can reduce physical abuse of women by men, but also that they may increase non-physical abuse, such as emotional abuse or controlling behaviour. It supports both the theory that increased income lowers stress-related abuse and the theory that increased income enables the woman to bargain out of abuse. The relatively strong evidence that decision-making power increases for women in the beneficiary household also offers substance to this latter theory. </li></ul>

<ul><li>SUMMARY: test</li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>We divide the willingness to pay by the net cost to the government to form each policy's Marginal Value of Public Funds, or its "MVPF". Comparing MVPFs across policies provides a unified method of assessing their impact on social welfare</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>In this paper, we examine the Marginal Value of Public Funds of 133 different historical policies over the last half-century in the United States. We find a clear and persistent pattern that direct investments in children have yielded the largest MVPFs. There is a large "bang for the buck" associated with a range of expenditures on children from early education to child health insurance to college expenditures.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>in a meaningful number of cases these policies pay for themselves. In particular, when government expenditures boost human capital, the resulting increase in net government revenue can offset the policy's upfront costs. From a taxpayer perspective, these expenditures on children are investments, rather than just transfers.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>We find that opportunities for high return investments in children have persisted across policy categories for many decades. This is, however, no guarantee that all future investment in these categories will produce high MVPFs.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>The 133 policies included in this paper are just a small subset of the policies that could be analyzed using the MVPF. We do not discuss the MVPF of crime policies, environmental policies, macroeconomic stabilization policies, or infrastructure policies, amongst many others. With careful tracking of willingness to pay and net costs, the MVPF can be used in any of these contexts and can guide cost-benefit analyses.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>The US publicly supported family planning effort serves millions of women and men each year, and this analysis provides new estimates of its positive impact on a wide range of health outcomes and its net savings to the government.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>The public investment in family planning programs and providers not only helps women and couples avoid unintended pregnancy and abortion, but also helps many thousands avoid cervical cancer, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, infertility, and preterm and low birth weight births.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>This investment resulted in net government savings of $13.6 billion in 2010, or $7.09 for every public dollar spent.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>In 2010, care provided during publicly supported family plan- ning visits averted an estimated 2.2 million unintended pregnancies, including 287,500 closely spaced and 164,190 preterm or low birth weight (LBW) births, 99,100 cases of chlamydia, 16,240 cases of gonorrhea, 410 cases of HIV, and 13,170 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease that would have led to 1,130 ec- topic pregnancies and 2,210 cases of infertility. Pap and HPV tests and HPV vaccinations prevented an estimated 3,680 cases of cervical cancer and 2,110 cervical cancer deaths; HPV vaccination also prevented 9,000 cases of abnormal sequelae and precancerous lesions. Services provided at health centers supported by the Title X national family planning program accounted for more than half of these benefits. The gross public savings attributed to these services totaled approximately $15.8 billion—$15.7 billion from preventing unplanned births, $123 million from STI/HIV testing, and $23 million from Pap and HPV test- ing and vaccines. Subtracting $2.2 billion in program costs from gross savings resulted in net public-sector savings of $13.6 billion.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Public expenditures for the US family planning program not only prevented unintended pregnancies but also reduced the incidence and impact of preterm and LBW births, STIs, infertility, and cervical cancer. This investment saved the government billions of public dollars, equivalent to an estimated taxpayer savings of $7.09 for every public dollar spent.</li></ul>
