Welfare programs in general can be seen to: provide consistent positive rates of return to society; is more consistent when it works to improve human capital; and the rate of reuturn is more consistent and higher if it is targeted at children and their development. Therefore: cash transfers do not lead to signifcant detriments to society (rather the opposite) and welfare programs that provide for children provide substantial benefits to society as a whole; this all means that such policies ought to be pursued where possible, so as to improve both developed and developing economies further.</li></ul>

<ul><li>SUMMARY: This study from the World Bank determines that: with the introduction of cash transfers in drastically different countries with different cultures, people do not use their financial aid to spend on demerit goods which could fuel certain addictions. In fact, for studies which did not show the it had not impact, certain studies showed that spending of demerit goods fell. Therefore: amongst low-income countries, it can be seen that regardless of the cash transfer program or the region it was trialed in, financial aid does not lead to money being spent on demerit goods more so than if there was no aid at all; this means an argument against social spending, and cash transfers specifically, that claims these programs should be discontinues because they fuel alcohol or tabacco addictions, lack sufficient merit.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>In this study, we use the term “temptation goods” principally to refer to alcohol and tobacco. This study makes no normative assumption as to the value of alcohol and tobacco expenditures but merely seeks to systematically characterize the literature on the impact of cash transfers on these goods.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Most cash transfer programs are not focused on either increasing or decreasing consumption of these goods specifically, and so most evaluations and the subsequent reviews have not focused on these. Rather, reviews have focused on outcomes in schooling (Saavedra and García 2013; Baird et al. 2014), health (Leroy, Ruel, and Verhofstadt 2009; Ranganathan and Lagarde 2012), con- sumption (Fiszbein and Schady 2009), or a combination of these (IEG 2011). At the same time, many individual evaluations of cash transfer programs have included analysis of the impact on some set of temptation goods within their consumption analysis.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Across 50 estimates from 19 studies, we find that almost without exception, studies find either no significant impact or a significant negative impact of transfers on expenditures on alcohol and tobacco. Moreover, our meta-analysis for those studies reporting impacts of transfers on total temptation good expen- diture yields a negative, significant average effect. Several robustness checks, including restricting to randomized trials alone, likewise yield negative (insignif- icant) average effects. </li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>The evidence suggests that cash transfers are not used for alcohol and tobacco at any significant levels, irrespective of region or program design.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>This finding informs the policy debate in many low-income countries as to whether to introduce cash transfer programs. The vast majority of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have formally discussed, planned, or piloted some form of cash transfer program (Garcia and Moore 2012). It also informs policy sur- rounding the choice between cash and in-kind transfers, as has been debated in India over the last several years (Drèze 2011; Times of India 2013), insofar as that debate is at least partly driven by public concern that recipients are more likely to spend cash transfers on temptation goods than they are to spend in-kind transfers (Khera 2014). By demonstrating that cash transfers do not in fact increase spending on temptation goods, we implicitly answer this question and further dispel concerns surrounding cash transfers.</li></ul>

<ul><li>SUMMARY: In data from 6 developing nations, it was found that cash transfers do not meaningfully lead to lower labour participation. Therefore: cash transfers do not cripple labour supply or participation in a meaningful way.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>We re-analyze the data from seven randomized controlled trials of government-run cash transfer programs in six developing countries throughout the world, and find no systematic evidence that cash transfer programs discourage work.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Chetty and Looney (2007) show that social insurance as a fraction of GDP rises as countries get richer, suggesting that safety nets may be increasingly important as countries grow and develop.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Aggregating evidence from randomized evaluations of seven government cash transfer programs, we find no systematic evidence of an impact of transfers on work behavior, either for men or women. Moreover, a 2014 review of transfer programs worldwide by Evans and Popova (2014) also shows no evidence—despite claims in the policy debate—that the transfers induce increases in spending on temptation goods, such as alcohol and tobacco. Thus, on net, the available evidence implies that cash transfer programs do not induce the “bad” behaviors that are often attributed to them in the policy space. Combined with the positive effects of transfer programs documented in the literature, this suggests that transfers can be an effective policy lever to help combat poverty and inequality.</li></ul>

<ul><li>SUMMARY: There are three kinds of results which were found: 1) studies which found no significant impact; 2) those that found a significant rise in work participation and labour intensity by able-bodied adults; 3) studies which found falls in labour participation and intensity exclusivedly in the 'elderly, those caring for dependents' or 'reductions in casual work'. Therefore: based on those three kinds of results, it can be determined that cash transfers either would not make the labour participation or intensity in able-bodied adults fall, or they would rise; and that this kind of policy would be good at providing security towards those who should not be working (e.g the elderly). </li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>for just over half of studies on adult work (participation and intensity), the cash transfer does not have a statistically significant impact. Among those studies reporting a significant effect among adults of working age, the majority find an increase in work participation and intensity.

<ul><li>SUMMARY: Cash transfers are effective tools to: lower poverty; increase school attendance (for boys and girls, which is important in developing nations); improve dietary metrics ('use of health services, dietary diversity and anthropometric measures'); decrease in child labour (important for developing countries); increase the independece of women by lowering the odds of physical abuse by men (though this can sometimes manifest into more controlling behaviours by men over women). Therefore: for develping and developed nations alike, cash transfers are signifcantly effective tools to help fight against a variety of societal issues.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Monetary Poverty</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>There is a comparatively large evidence base linking cash transfers to reductions in monetary poverty. The evidence extracted consistently shows an increase in total and food expenditure and reduction in Foster–Greer–Thorbecke (FGT) poverty measures.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>While cash transfers are shown to mostly increase total and food expenditure, it appears that in many cases this impact is not big enough to have a subsequent effect on aggregate poverty levels. However, with one exception, the studies consistently show decreases in poverty.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Education</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>available evidence highlights a clear link between cash transfer receipt and increased school attendance. Less evidence and a less clear-cut pattern of impact is found for learning outcomes (as measured by test scores) and cognitive development outcomes (information processing ability, intelligence, reasoning, language development and memory), although, interestingly, the three studies reporting statistically significant findings on the latter all report improvements in cognitive development associated with cash transfer receipt.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>20 studies disaggregate findings by sex (either by sex of the child or head of the household), with statistically significant effects being increases in school attendance for girls </li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Health and Nutrition</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>Evidence of the impacts of cash transfers across all three indicator areas – use of health services, dietary diversity and anthropometric measures – was largely consistent in terms of direction of effect, showing improvements in the indicators. </li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>The available evidence shows that, on the whole, cash transfers – both CCTs and UCTs – have increased the uptake of health services. Of the 15 studies reporting overall effects on the use of health facilities, nine report statistically significant increases. For dietary diversity, findings also consistently show increases. Among the 12 studies reporting on impacts on dietary diversity, seven show statistically significant changes across a range of dietary diversity measures, all being improvements. Evidence of statistically significant changes in anthropometric outcomes is limited to five out of 13 studies for stunting, one out of five for wasting and one out of eight for underweight. All significant overall changes were improvements.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Savings, investment and production</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>Overall, impacts on savings, and on livestock ownership and/or purchase, as well as use and/or purchase of agricultural inputs, are consistent in their direction of effect, with almost all statistically significant findings highlighting positive effects of cash transfers, though these are not universal to all programmes or to all types of livestock and inputs. </li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li> of the 10 studies that look at the overall effect of cash transfers on household savings, half find statistically significant increases in the share of households reporting savings (ranging from seven to 24 percentage points) or the amount of savings accumulated. Impacts on borrowing were mixed. Of the 15 studies, four report significant increases, three report significant reductions, one reports mixed findings and the remainder are not statistically significant.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Employment</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>for just over half of studies on adult work (participation and intensity), the cash transfer does not have a statistically significant impact. Among those studies reporting a significant effect among adults of working age, the majority find an increase in work participation and intensity. In the cases in which a reduction in work participation or work intensity is reported, these reflect a reduction in participation among the elderly, those caring for dependents, or they are the result of reductions in casual work.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>14 studies report on the effect on overall adult labour force participation: among the eight that report on adults of working age, four find statistically significant impacts: three being increases and one a decrease. Among the two studies on elderly adults, one finds a significant effect in terms of reducing pensioners working for pay. 10 studies report on overall adult intensity of work, with six studies showing statistically significant impacts. Three involved reductions in time worked, though one was among the elderly. The two interventions resulting in increases in time spent working resulted from enterprise grants specificially intended to increase employment.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>Studies on sector of work show that in over half of the studies cash transfers did not significantly affect overall participation in the specific sectors studied</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>More specifically, a total of 19 studies report cash transfer impacts on child labour force participation. Of the eight studies that find any significant impact, all show a decrease in child labour.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Empowerment</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>available evidence shows that transfers can reduce physical abuse of women by men, but also that they may increase non-physical abuse, such as emotional abuse or controlling behaviour. It supports both the theory that increased income lowers stress-related abuse and the theory that increased income enables the woman to bargain out of abuse. The relatively strong evidence that decision-making power increases for women in the beneficiary household also offers substance to this latter theory. </li></ul>

<ul><li>SUMMARY: Welfare programs, like cash transfers, which are targeted at children consistently provide the highest positive rate of returns to society (other welfare programs include early education, healthcare, spending on colleges). Welfare programs which boost human capital (skills and education), often offset their original costs to implement it. Therefore: cash transfers and other welfare programs, especially those targetted at children, and good investements because the often profit a consistent return to society that is hgiher than the cost to implement such programs.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>We divide the willingness to pay by the net cost to the government to form each policy's Marginal Value of Public Funds, or its "MVPF". Comparing MVPFs across policies provides a unified method of assessing their impact on social welfare</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>In this paper, we examine the Marginal Value of Public Funds of 133 different historical policies over the last half-century in the United States. We find a clear and persistent pattern that direct investments in children have yielded the largest MVPFs. There is a large "bang for the buck" associated with a range of expenditures on children from early education to child health insurance to college expenditures.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>in a meaningful number of cases these policies pay for themselves. In particular, when government expenditures boost human capital, the resulting increase in net government revenue can offset the policy's upfront costs. From a taxpayer perspective, these expenditures on children are investments, rather than just transfers.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>We find that opportunities for high return investments in children have persisted across policy categories for many decades. This is, however, no guarantee that all future investment in these categories will produce high MVPFs.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>The 133 policies included in this paper are just a small subset of the policies that could be analyzed using the MVPF. We do not discuss the MVPF of crime policies, environmental policies, macroeconomic stabilization policies, or infrastructure policies, amongst many others. With careful tracking of willingness to pay and net costs, the MVPF can be used in any of these contexts and can guide cost-benefit analyses.</li></ul>

<h3 id=3-2-1_content_summary><a href="#3-2-1_content_summary">Content summary</a></h3><ul><li>A UBI, an unconditional form of a cash transfer, can be introduced in different manners. These include child allowances that are provided per child for all children, or an income which is provided per adult for all adults, or other variations discussed in the literature. Regardless: it positively increases the participation of adults who now have money for transport and other crucial expenses; lowers participation amongst the elderly, children, those with disabilities, and others for whom society should not encourage to work; overall increases the labour supply because of the first point; and that a UBI in whatever form leads to permanent economic output increase with increased growth for 8 years, leading to improvements in employment, output, and wages, and a rise in prices. Therefore: a UBI that targets children or adults would be a good policy tool for compating unemployment, low wages, and would not discourage those receiving it from working where they are able to. </li></ul>
<h4>[•Is There Empirical Evidence on How the Implementation of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) Affects Labour Supply? A Systematic Review•, 2020, Manuela A. de Paz-Báñez, María José Asensio-Coto, Celia Sánchez-López, María-Teresa Aceytuno] - systematic review of 18 empirical cases and 38 studies</h4>
<ul><li>LINK: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/22/9459/htm" style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline">https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/22/9459/htm</a></li></ul>
<ul><li>SUMMARY: Based on this analysis of different UBI experiments, trials, and microsimulations (in both developed and developing nations alike) it was found that the labour supply/participation does not decrease meaningfully amongst adults of most ages, and for men and women. Rather, not only does it increase with adult men and women, but it also causes the labour supply from 'the elderly, the sick, those with disabilities, women with young children to look after, or young people who continued studying'. This fall from these selective demographics not only are positive for society, but additionally it is not large enough to offset the rise from adults who are willing and able to work. Therefore: UBI, and other similar programs, do not lead to the labour supply of nations falling (rather the opposite); and it is a good tool for lowering child labour, lowering  elderly labour, labour from the sick, labour from those who mst take care of children, and labour from those currently studying; these lead to benefits socially, and the fall from those categories do not offset the overall rise seen in labour supply; this means UBI is a good policy for preventing the vulnerable from being forced to work, and would not be detrimental to overall participation in the economy.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>[Places where policy was tested: </li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>Partial UBI: Alaska, Iran </li></ul>

<ul style="margin-left:40px"><li>Microsimulation: Australia, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom, European Union, Ecuador]</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>The results speak for themselves: Despite a detailed search, we have not found any evidence of a significant reduction in labour supply. Instead, we found evidence that labour supply increases globally among adults, men and women, young and old, and the existence of some insignificant and functional reductions to the system such as a decrease in workers from the following categories: Children, the elderly, the sick, those with disabilities, women with young children to look after, or young people who continued studying. These reductions do not reduce the overall supply since it is largely offset by increased supply from other members of the community</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>a considerable decrease in the labour supply would make its application unsustainable despite its positive effects in reducing poverty, inequality, or improving the physical and psychological health of the most disadvantaged population. On the contrary, an increase in the labour supply, the absence of a significant result, or a small reduction, especially in some cases (children, the elderly, the sick, etc.) may be one more argument in favour of its implementation.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>we have not found any empirical evidence that the implementation of a UBI causes a reduction in the labour supply that makes it unsustainable in the long term. In strictly scientific terms, no evidence has been found of most of the negative effects attributed to a UBI. Despite the limitations of the methodologies used for these empirical analyses, the results speak for themselves.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>we found a slight decrease in the labour supply, in terms of the number of hours worked and participation, in some cases. These cases are usually related to the need to dedicate time to other activities: Basically, care and training. There is also a slight reduction in some cases of the elderly population and in people with disabilities, and a more important decrease in the labour supply of children. We found only one case, in Iran, where the population between 20 and 29 years old reduces their labour supply partly to dedicate themselves to training, but it is not clear that another part is not simply dedicated to leisure since they have little attachment to work. However, it is limited and this result has been questioned by subsequent studies</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>In some cases, there is also a transfer of the working population from poorly paid jobs with poor working conditions to jobs with better conditions and wages, or towards entrepreneurship. This is observed with the strategy of more training and better conditions to be able to negotiate with the employer, as it is not necessary to take any job only to survive.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>other evidence has been the activation of people who were not able to relocate, buy clean clothes, and lacked a means of transportation, in addition to not having the constant threat of losing the aid that allows them to survive if they accept a very temporary job. This has increased the labour supply in the adult population of working age in general, both male and female, especially on low incomes. Therefore, increases in labour supply are observed in the underprivileged population in general</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Keynesian rooted theories that are based on demand and not only on supply, suggest that UBI will improve local consumption and with it the demand for local employment with effects on the improvement of working conditions and productivity, which would improve wages and with it the labour supply without causing inflation, in principle. This has also been observed in empirical evidence, as we have seen above.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Although it is not the subject of this systematic review, we have also found positive effects in other labour aspects: The improvement in working conditions in the worst jobs seems related to a greater capacity for labour negotiation; the increase in formal employment for lower jobs, especially if this measure replaces conditional transfers, due to the possibility of combining formal employment and benefit. Changes towards better jobs and entrepreneurship have also been observed. Another aspect of interest is the change in labour demand.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>UBI is not only an effective instrument to reduce poverty and inequality and improve social welfare, but it is also sustainable in relation to employment.</li></ul>

<ul><li>SUMMARY: This report by the Roosevelt Institute argues that not is it an affordable initiative (even with the $1000 per adult proposal), but it would expand the economy signifianctly (12.56% over 8 years under the $1000 proposal). Though, after those 8 years pass, economic growth is likely to return closer to baseline levels, but does not offset the benefit from those 8 years. Furthermore, if this were financed through taxation, it would have many cascading benefits because more money for lower household income individuals are more likely to spend and consume more. This leads to increases in 'output, employment, prices, and wages'. What must also be noted is that this would be a positive initiative for economic growth even if this was limited to a $250 dollar universal child allowance ($250 per child). Therefore: a UBI, and other generous cash transfer initiatives, are affordable if financed through taxation; it would lead to a permanent increase in economic output (due to an increased economic growth compared to baseline for 8 years); and it would additionally rises in employment, prices, and wages; meaning a UBI would be a positive tool at fighting unemployment, low wages, and permanently increasing economic output.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Overall, we find that the economy can not only withstand large increases in federal spending, but could also grow thanks to the stimulative effects of cash transfers on the economy.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>enacting a UBI and paying for it by increasing the federal debt would grow the economy. Under the smallest spending scenario, $250 per month for each child, GDP is 0.79% larger than under the baseline forecast after eight years. According to the Levy Model, the largest cash program - $1,000 for all adults annually - expands the economy by 12.56% over the baseline after eight years. After eight years of enactment, the stimulative effects of the program dissipate and GDP growth returns to the baseline forecast, but the level of output remains permanently higher.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>when the model is adapted to include distributional effects, the economy grows, even in the tax-financed scenarios. This occurs because the distributional model incorporates the idea that an extra dollar in the hands of lower income households leads to higher spending. In other words, the households that pay more in taxes than they receive in cash assistance have a low propensity to consume, and those that receive more in assistance than they pay in taxes have a high propensity to consume. Thus, even when the policy is tax- rather than debt-financed, there is an increase in output, employment, prices, and wages.</li></ul>

<h3 id=3-3-1_content_summary:><a href="#3-3-1_content_summary:">Content summary:</a></h3><ul><li>Ignoring the philosophical arguments for and against family planning, it works well as a money-saving policy. This si because it is effective at preventing situations which would cost the government more in the long term, such as higher prevelance of sexually transmitted diseases, unwanted births, cervical cancers diagnoses, and abortion. This leads to family planning as a service offered as policy effective at providing significant savings to society and the government. Therefore: family planning programs as policy are effective, provide returns to society, and thus developed and developing countries alike would very likely benefit from implementing similar services.</li></ul>

<ul><li>SUMMARY: Family planning in the United States, due to helping prevent unintented pregnancies, avoid  cervical cancer, sexually transmitted diseases (like HIV), and preterm/low weight births, it means the government saves billions in dollars. The ratio of money-saved to money-spent being 7.09 dollars per dollar spent in family planning.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>The US publicly supported family planning effort serves millions of women and men each year, and this analysis provides new estimates of its positive impact on a wide range of health outcomes and its net savings to the government.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>The public investment in family planning programs and providers not only helps women and couples avoid unintended pregnancy and abortion, but also helps many thousands avoid cervical cancer, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, infertility, and preterm and low birth weight births.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>This investment resulted in net government savings of $13.6 billion in 2010, or $7.09 for every public dollar spent.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>In 2010, care provided during publicly supported family planning visits averted an estimated 2.2 million unintended pregnancies, including 287,500 closely spaced and 164,190 preterm or low birth weight (LBW) births, 99,100 cases of chlamydia, 16,240 cases of gonorrhea, 410 cases of HIV, and 13,170 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease that would have led to 1,130 ec-topic pregnancies and 2,210 cases of infertility. Pap and HPV tests and HPV vaccinations prevented an estimated 3,680 cases of cervical cancer and 2,110 cervical cancer deaths; HPV vaccination also prevented 9,000 cases of abnormal sequelae and precancerous lesions. Services provided at health centers supported by the Title X national family planning program accounted for more than half of these benefits. The gross public savings attributed to these services totaled approximately $15.8 billion—$15.7 billion from preventing unplanned births, $123 million from STI/HIV testing, and $23 million from Pap and HPV test- ing and vaccines. Subtracting $2.2 billion in program costs from gross savings resulted in net public-sector savings of $13.6 billion.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Public expenditures for the US family planning program not only prevented unintended pregnancies but also reduced the incidence and impact of preterm and LBW births, STIs, infertility, and cervical cancer. This investment saved the government billions of public dollars, equivalent to an estimated taxpayer savings of $7.09 for every public dollar spent.</li></ul>
