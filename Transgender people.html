<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Moreover, in the literature, there is evidence that both testosterone and estrogen may play a role in breast cancer risk. Testosterone is thought to have a protective effect, and estrogen a stimulating effect. Because transwomen are commonly treated with both estrogen and anti-androgens, the increase of circulating estrogen and loss of circulating testos- terone could contribute to the observed increased breast cancer risk compared with cisgender men.</li></ul>

<ul><li>SUMMARY: test</li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Estrogen and its metabolites have been confirmed as carcinogens of breast tissue. Additionally, in cisgender individuals, the length and amount of exposure to estrogens is thought to add to breast cancer risk. Therefore, trans- gender women undergoing medical transition with exogenous estrogens have hormonal factors contributing to their increased breast cancer risk when compared with cisgender men.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>transgender women have a higher prevalence (60%) of dense breast tissue, an independent risk for breast cancer, and in- creased rates of false-negative mammograms.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>because of the likely lower incidence of breast cancer in transgender women, screening mammography should not begin before the age of 50. For transgender women not beginning estrogen therapy until after age 50, it is not recommended to begin breast cancer screening until a minimum of 5 years of feminizing hormone use.</li></ul>

<ul><li>SUMMARY: test</li></ul>
<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Transgender women may have a greater chance of getting breast cancer due to the medicines they take to boost female hormones and lower male hormones. A person’s family history and genetic makeup can also increase their chances of breast cancer.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>If you are 50 years of age or older and you had at least 5 years of hormonal therapy, you should have a screening mammogram every 2 years.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>If you’re a trans woman and have not had bottom surgery, you aren’t at risk for cervical cancer.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>If, however, you’re a trans woman who has had bottom surgery to create a vagina (vaginoplasty) and possibly a cervix, there’s a very small risk that you can develop cancer in the tissues of your neo-vagina or neo-cervix. The risk depends on the type of surgery you had, the type of tissue used to create your vagina and cervix and your personal health history. Talk to your healthcare provider to figure out your specific cancer-screening needs as part of your overall pelvic health following surgery.</li></ul>

<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>human papillomavirus (HPV)</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Transgender women with surgically created neovaginas are also at risk for contracting HPV and subsequently developing dysplasia or invasive cancer.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Neovagina creation in transgender women through penile inversion is the most common technique for vaginoplasty, which results in the keratinized skin from the penile shaft lining the neovagina and a portion of the glans penis creating a neoclitoris. Like all keratinized skin, the neovagina is also susceptible to HPV- induced dysplasia.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Additionally, the development of diversion colitis, from the diversion of the fecal stream resulting in a deficiency of nutrients for the colonocytes, leads to long-term inflammation, which theoretically can be associated with increased cancer risk of the neovagina. However, as with all cancer data in the transgender population, no specific incidence or prevalence data exists on cancers of the neovagina. Transgender women who have undergone vaginoplasty, regardless of method, should receive routine examination for the presence of HPV condyloma.</li></ul>
