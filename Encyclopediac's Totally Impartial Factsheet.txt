##### Gender & Sexism
#### [C] Impact of Academic Self-Concept (ASC) on Education and Achievement - And the Differences in Gender.
### Content summary:
- Not only is ASC closely linked to academic achievement, but it can be seen that increasing the former has positive implications for the latter. Additionally, a consistent gender gap in ASC can be seen across multiple western cultures from grades 7-11, and the gap is likely traceable to gender-stereotypes. A certain ASC in specific domains (boys are seen to lead in ASC in most domains, though not all) can lead to students pursuing different careers and subjects in the future. Therefore: since differing ASCs in certain domains lead to different career and expertise choices later on in life, one way to improve gender distribution in professions and subjects could be seeking to fight against gender stereotypes to decrease the ASC gender gap, which also could lead to improved academic achivement by girls in certain domains.

### Why ASC is Important: Reciprocal Link Between ASC and Academic Achievement.
[•A Meta-analysis of the Longitudinal Relationship Between Academic Self-Concept and Academic Achievement•, 2021, Huimin Wu, Yiqun Guo, Yingkai Yang, Le Zhao, Cheng Guo] - meta-analysis of 68 longitudinal studies (240 effect sizes)
- LINK: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-021-09600-1
- SUMMARY: There is a signifiant reciprocal relationship between ASC and Academic Achievement (AA) (one is able to affect and predict the other, and vice-versa). This meta-analysis reflects sample sizes from mostly culturally western backgrounds, and China. The relevant domains investigated were verbal and mathematical. The relationship between ASC and AA was moderated by age, though the relationship still holds for children and adolescents. Therefore: promoting ASC is important in improving AA in educational contexts.
- Key Quotes:
* The reciprocal relationship between academic self-concept (ASC) and academic achievement has been documented in multiple studies.
* The results found that achievement significantly predicted ASC (β = 0.16, p < 0.01) and vice-versa (β = 0.08, p < 0.01) after controlling for the initial level of outcome variables, which provided further evidence for the reciprocal effects model (REM). 
* The 68 studies included in the present meta-analysis were published between 1981 and 2020, with a median publication year in 2011. In total, 240 effect sizes were reported based on 72 independent samples. Sample sizes ranged from 43 to 14,985 (M = 1,538, SD = 2,687, Median [Mdn] = 546). The proportion of female participants ranged from 0 to 100%, with a mean of 47.17%. The average age of participants at the first assessment varied between 6.60 and 20.50 (M = 12.19, SD = 2.92, Mdn = 12.20). Time lags between assessments ranged from 3 to 66 months (M = 20.62, SD = 13.46, Mdn = 18). Most publications were conducted in the US (33.8%), Germany (17.6%), China (10.3%), Canada (5.9%), and Australia (5.9%). In total, 58.8% of studies explored the relationship between ASC and achievement in verbal or mathematical domains, while the remainder explored the relationship between general ASC and achievement.
* The current meta-analysis explored the longitudinal relationship between ASC and achievement and its moderators by a focus upon available studies. Consistent with previous longitudinal studies (e.g., Wigfield & Eccles, 2000; Marsh et al., 2002; Gorges et al., 2018; Weidinger et al., 2018; Sewasew & Schroeders, 2019), our results found that ASC and achievement affected each other mutually within domains over time, supporting the REM.
* The REM suggests that students are likely to feel more competent in subjects in which they perform better, and the sense of competence also affects subsequent achievement.
* Our findings corroborated the argument that a positive ASC is an important educational outcome and a mediating variable that promotes the development of achievement (Marsh & Martin, 2011; Möller et al., 2009).
* Moderator analyses revealed that the effect of ASC on achievement and the effect of achievement on ASC were moderated by student age, although the support for the REM was found in both childhood and adolescence.
* What factors might explain this developmental change? During elementary school, students’ ASC undergoes a process of shaping and reshaping that is dominated by cumulative achievement-related success and failure (Skaalvik & Hagtvet, 1990). The motivational properties of ASC have not been fully developed; thus, their influence on achievement is limited (Helmke & van Aken, 1995). However, ASC is expected to exert increasing effects on achievement or other academic choices when it is firmly established and more stable (Wigfield & Karpathian, 1991)
* Age differences in the relationship between ASC and achievement might be related to the maturation of cognitive ability, which enables students to make inferences regarding their own and others’ competence by integrating multiple information resources such as performance feedback and reflected appraisals from significant others (Weidinger et al., 2018).
* Furthermore, significant changes have occurred in the educational environment for students beyond elementary school, with students having to participate in an increasing number of normative evaluations and receive more judgments from teachers (Dweck, 2002; Stipek & Iver, 1989). Such feedback helps students to establish competence beliefs more firmly, thereby boosting the effect of ASC on achievement.
* The effect of ASC on achievement for low-achieving students was significantly weaker than typical-achieving students. Low-achieving students experience less success and more academic challenges, which can lead to their academic motivation being weakened and the effect of ASC on achievement being greatly reduced (Hampton & Mason, 2003; Prast et al., 2018). Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the implications of ASC for achievement for low-achieving students. Instead, high ASC might be especially beneficial for subsequent achievement among low-achieving students because the motivational properties of ASC could initiate adaptive learning strategies and behaviors such as efforts and persistence, which would have a positive effect on future achievement and success (Marsh, 1990; Marsh & Martin, 2011; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000).
* Studies using standardized tests as indicators of achievement tended to report a weaker relationship between ASC and achievement than studies using grades or teacher-rating as indicators. As mentioned in the introduction, standardized testing is not high-stakes and not of personal significance for the students, while grades and teacher-rating often serve other functions such as motivating students (Kriegbaum et al., 2018; Pinxten et al., 2010). ASC possesses motivational properties, so this leads to the closer correlation between ASC and grade or teacher-rating as they are directly related to motivation (Valentine et al., 2004; Wylie, 1974).

### Consistent Gender Gap in ASC in Secondary Education.
[•The Development of Students' Mathematics Self‐Concept in Relation to Gender: Different Countries, Different Trajectories?•, 2010, Gabriel Nagy, Helen M. G. Watt, Jacquelynne S. Eccles, Ulrich Trautwein, Oliver Lüdtke, Jürgen Baumert]
- LINK: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00644.x
- SUMMARY: This study shows that there is a consistent gender gap in ASC throughout different ages in Australia, Germany, and the United States. This gap is stable and consistent for all ages of students that were studied, though the gap never increases or decreases in size. This is important because of the link between ASC and achievement, and how this leads to students making different choices in expertise later in life, this gap is important. The study claims the consistency can be explained by effects seen before or after grade 7-11 education is finished. The authors suggest that this can be from before grade 7, and that may likely be inspired by gender stereotypes. Therefore: there are consistent gender gaps in ASC across different western nations, which can likely be explained by gender stereotypes; futhermore, the differences likely lead to different choices in careers and study down the line.
- Key Quotes:
* This study extends previous research by examining the development of mathematics self‐concept across grades 7–12 in three cultural settings: Australia (Sydney; N=1,333), the United States (Michigan; N=2,443), and Germany (four federal states; N=4,688). Results of latent growth curve models document very similar patterns of self‐concept development in males and females in the three settings. First, gender differences in favor of boys were observed at the beginning of the observation period (grade 7). Second, gender was not significantly related to self‐concept change in either group, meaning that initial differences persisted across time. Third, the results provided no evidence that the form of the longitudinal change trajectories for mathematics self‐concept differed across the cultural settings.
* Given the close connection of academic self‐concept to achievement and achievement‐related choices, and given the potential of this construct to explain gendered patterns of choice behavior, the widespread interest in gender differences in self‐concept development is hardly surprising.
* The present investigation was undertaken to provide more conclusive evidence on how cultural and institutional influences impact adolescents' self‐concept development. To this end, we focused on one domain‐specific academic self‐concept, namely, mathematics self‐concept.
* [Australia Results:] The raw data indicate a small decreasing trend in mean mathematics self‐concept scores accompanied by decreasing variances. Furthermore, the mathematics self‐concept scales were significantly correlated with gender, although the magnitude of the association was rather small.
* Boys had a higher mathematics self‐concept than girls in grade 7 (b=.31, SE=.06, p<.01), but there was no gender difference in the amount of change (b=−.02, SE=.06, p=.36). Overall, this pattern of results indicates stable gender differences in mathematics self‐concept that neither diminish nor increase over the course of secondary education in Australia. Figure 2 illustrates the mean self‐concept trajectories for the total sample and by gender. As shown, the trajectories were nonlinear and appear to decline slightly more in senior grades.

* [Germany Results:] Mean scores indicate a decreasing trend for mathematics self‐concept. Correlations with gender suggest that gender differences remained stable across time.
* In sum, the analyses of the German data document decreasing trends in mathematics self‐concept. The results also provide evidence for gender differences in mathematics self‐concept, but not for relations between students' gender and the amount of change in self‐concept. This pattern of results is illustrated in Figure 3.

* [US Results:] Figure 4 illustrates the mean self‐concept trajectories for the total sample and by gender. As shown, the trajectories appear to be linear across the three time points under consideration.

* The analyses presented drew on large student samples and overcame some of the shortcomings of previous attempts to compare the results of different primary investigations.
* a general decline in mathematics self‐concept was evident in all three countries. There was no evidence for qualitative differences across settings in this pattern of change. Second, consistent gender differences in mathematics self‐concept were found in all settings. Males scored higher than females at the beginning of grade 7 in all contexts, but the magnitude of these gender differences varied. The largest differences were found for Germany, with smaller gender gaps in Australia (Sydney) and the United States (Michigan). Third, and most surprising, there was no evidence for gender differences in self‐concept change (consistent with patterns for perceived talent; Watt, 2004). This pattern is inconsistent with both the gender intensification model and the gender convergence hypothesis.
* findings suggest that—at least for the cultural settings examined, the period from grades 7 to 12, and the mathematical domain—initial gender differences in self‐concept persist unchanged. This does not imply that there are no gender differences in self‐concept development per se. It seems more likely—at least for the mathematical domain—that such differences materialize before or/and after the period considered here. Indeed, the findings provided by Jacobs et al. (2002) suggest that the largest gender‐related changes occur between grades 1 and 7, a period that was not included in the present study.
* some research suggests that gender differences in mathematics self‐concept emerge as early as the beginning of primary school (Fredricks & Eccles, 2002; Jacobs et al., 2002). From this perspective, stereotypic gender roles seem to have an important impact early in individual developmental trajectories. Our research suggests that such stereotypes seem to be more influential in some countries (e.g., Germany) than in others. This finding is line with the higher gender norm differentiation reported for German society (Williams & Best, 1990).

#### [C] Academic Self-Efficacy (ASE) and Impacts on Achievement - and Differences In Gender.
### Content summary:
- ASE is a key predictor of academic achievement and can influence career path and achievement. ASE differs from ASC in that ASE is more task-specific, whereas ASC is more domain-specific (narrow vs. broad). Differences in ASE by girls and boys shows tha boys lead in many ASE metrics, though not all, and that this gap grows more significant with age. The gaps are consistent with gender stereotypes. Therefore: to improve gender balances in a careers and 'economic achievement', society ought to fight against gender stereotypes to prevent the ASE gap from manifesting in a significant way.

### Gender Gap in ASE, The Importance of ASE, and the Difference between ASE and ASC.
[•Gender differences in academic self-efficacy: a meta-analysis•, 2012, Chiungjung Huang] - meta-analysis of 187 studies, with a total sample size of 68,429.
- LINK: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10212-011-0097-y 
- SUMMARY: This meta-analysis examines the gender-gap in ASE. This is different from ASC, in that ASC normally self-evaluation of domain-specific skills, whereas ASE is for task-specific skills self-evaluation (broad vs. specific). ASE is important because, like ASC, it is a key predictor of academic success. The meta-analysis found significant differences between the ASE of boys and girls, though it was small (0.08 effect size value). Despite it being small, this is still important as ASE is an important predictor in 'academic/career choice' for students of all genders and leads to different career paths, and thus 'economic achievement', due to ASE causing different choices in higher education subjects and career choices. Boys were seen to lead in Mathematics, Computer, and Social Sciences (though the number of studies showing the lead in Social Sciences is small, so it should be taken with a grain of salt); girls were higher in arts. For Science, no differences were found. The effect sizes (the gender gap in ASE) of the meta-analysis were more likely to be signifcant for older students, for instance, all effect sizes for Mathematics ASE in students older than 14 were significantly different from 0 (with boys having higher ASE than girls) though it was not significant for students younger than 14.
- Key Quotes:
* A meta-analysis of 187 studies containing 247 independent studies (N = 68,429) on gender differences in academic self-efficacy identified an overall effect size of 0.08, with a small difference favoring males. Moderator analysis demonstrated that content domain was a significant moderator in explaining effect size variation. Females displayed higher language arts self-efficacy than males. Meanwhile, males exhibited higher mathematics, computer, and social sciences self-efficacy than females. Gender differences in academic self-efficacy also varied with age. The largest effect size occurred for respondents aged over 23 years old. For mathematics self-efficacy, the significant gender differences emerged in late adolescence.
* Bandura (1977, 1982, 1986) defined self-efficacy as the perceived ability of an individual to succeed at or accomplish certain tasks.
* Academic self-efficacy is essential to academic success (Lent et al. 1984, 1986, 1987). The criterion-related validity of academic self-efficacy has been documented by several primary studies and one meta-analysis. Multon et al. (1991) analyzed 36 studies that examined the relation of academic self-efficacy with performance and persistence and identified a mean correlation of r = 0.38 for performance and r = 0.34 for persistence. Given the importance of academic self-efficacy to academic achievement and persistence, determining whether academic self-efficacy is associated with other important variables is worthwhile.
* [Why ASC and ASE are different:] Pajares and Miller (1994) claimed that self-efficacy denotes an individual’s perceived ability to complete a specific task. Consequently, self-efficacy is directly related to a task, context, or situation. Self-concept is a more general and global assessment of self-attitudes than self-efficacy. Self-concept can be domain-specific but not task-specific.
* The effect size used in this study was Hedge’s g (Hedges and Olkin 1985), computed by subtracting female mean from the male mean, then dividing by the pooled standard deviation of both groups.
** Positive values for g reveal that males had higher academic self-efficacy than females, while negative values demonstrate that females outperformed males.
* For the 247 independent effect sizes, the mean was g = 0.08 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.03 to 0.12. As the significance of the mean effect size can be tested by 95% confidence interval, the mean effect size was significantly different from zero.
* the majority of the samples were conducted in the USA (N = 201), 14 were conducted in Taiwan, 9 in Canada, 5 in Australia, 3 in Israel, and 2 in Japan. China, Greece, India, Malaysia, Norway, Sultan, Sweden, Turkey, and UK each accounted for one sample.
* The mean effect sizes for language arts, mathematics, social science, and computer self-efficacy differed significantly from 0. For language arts self-efficacy, the mean effect size was g = −0.16, indicating higher female language arts self-efficacy. For mathematics self-efficacy, the mean effect sizes were g = 0.18, indicating higher male mathematics self-efficacy. Higher male self-efficacy than female self-efficacy was also observed for computer self-efficacy. These findings are consistent with gender stereotypes. Although males exhibited higher social science self-efficacy, this finding was based on only five data points, and therefore, caution is necessary in interpreting this result.
* Categorical model analyses indicate that gender differences exist in the four domains of academic self-efficacy—language arts, mathematics, computer, and the social sciences. Females had higher language arts self-efficacy than males, while males had higher self-efficacy in mathematics, computer, and the social sciences than females. As the number of studies on gender differences in self-efficacy of the social sciences was insufficient, findings for social sciences self-efficacy should be taken cautiously.
* Conversely, no gender differences exist in science self-efficacy.
* Pajares (2002) proposed that males and females have similar levels of mathematics self-efficacy during elementary school, while males develop higher mathematics self-efficacy than females by middle school. The age effect was supported by this meta-analysis. Effect sizes for students aged 15–18 and >23 years differed significantly from 0, as the 95% confidence interval did not include 0. For mathematics self-efficacy, no evidence existed for the emergence of a significant gender difference from childhood to early adolescence; in groups of students aged 6–10 and 11–14, effect sizes did not differ significantly from 0. Conversely, among all groups of students aged over 14, all effect sizes were statistically significant, with males having higher mathematics self-efficacy than females.
* The practical implication is that programs designed to improve the academic self-efficacy of girls are needed, especially for female adults. 
* Researchers may choose not report non-significant effect sizes because non-significant outcomes may not be published (Sutton 2009). Therefore, publication status may be a moderating factor for gender differences in academic self-efficacy. Findings obtained by this meta-analysis do not support this contention.
* This study tested the assumption of equality of variance of gender groups. Consistent with the finding for self-esteem (Kling et al. 1999), males and females displayed similar variances in terms of academic self-efficacy. Since equality of variance of gender groups holds, comparing means of academic self-efficacy between males and females is valid.
* To summarize, gender differences in academic self-efficacy were statistically significant but small. However, these small effects may have practical importance. Lent et al. (1986) and Lent et al. (2005) suggested that academic self-efficacy is a key variable in academic/career choice for both male and female students. Moreover, gender gaps in academic self-efficacy increase as age increased in this meta-analysis. Consequently, a small effect size during early life may result in differential economic achievement between males and females because of differences in academic self-efficacy, course selection, and career choices.
