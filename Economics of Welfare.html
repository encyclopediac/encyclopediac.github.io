<ul><li>Key Quotes:</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>In this study, we use the term “temptation goods” principally to refer to alcohol and tobacco. This study makes no normative assumption as to the value of alcohol and tobacco expenditures but merely seeks to systematically characterize the literature on the impact of cash transfers on these goods.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Most cash transfer programs are not focused on either increasing or decreas- ing consumption of these goods specifically, and so most evaluations and the subsequent reviews have not focused on these. Rather, reviews have focused on outcomes in schooling (Saavedra and García 2013; Baird et al. 2014), health (Leroy, Ruel, and Verhofstadt 2009; Ranganathan and Lagarde 2012), con- sumption (Fiszbein and Schady 2009), or a combination of these (IEG 2011). At the same time, many individual evaluations of cash transfer programs have included analysis of the impact on some set of temptation goods within their consumption analysis.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>Across 50 estimates from 19 studies, we find that almost without exception, studies find either no significant impact or a significant negative impact of trans- fers on expenditures on alcohol and tobacco. Moreover, our meta-analysis for those studies reporting impacts of transfers on total temptation good expen- diture yields a negative, significant average effect. Several robustness checks, in- cluding restricting to randomized trials alone, likewise yield negative (insignif- icant) average effects. </li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>The evidence suggests that cash transfers are not used for alcohol and tobacco at any significant levels, irrespective of region or program design.</li></ul>
<ul style="margin-left:20px"><li>This finding informs the policy debate in many low-income countries as to whether to introduce cash transfer programs. The vast majority of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have formally discussed, planned, or piloted some form of cash transfer program (Garcia and Moore 2012). It also informs policy sur- rounding the choice between cash and in-kind transfers, as has been debated in India over the last several years (Drèze 2011; Times of India 2013), insofar as that debate is at least partly driven by public concern that recipients are more likely to spend cash transfers on temptation goods than they are to spend in-kind transfers (Khera 2014). By demonstrating that cash transfers do not in fact increase spending on temptation goods, we implicitly answer this question and further dispel concerns surrounding cash transfers.</li></ul>
